    <string name="episode_overview">
        Rick, Maggie, and Ezekiel rally their communities together to take down Negan.
        Gregory attempts to have the Hilltop residents side with Negan, but they all firmly stand behind Maggie.
        The group attacks the Sanctuary, taking down its fences and flooding the compound with walkers.
        With the Sanctuary defaced, everyone leaves except Gabriel, who reluctantly stays to save Gregory,
        but is left behind when Gregory abandons him. Surrounded by walkers,
        Gabriel hides in a trailer, where he is trapped inside with Negan.
